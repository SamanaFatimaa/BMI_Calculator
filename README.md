# BMI Calculator Project

# Overview:
This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator helps individuals assess their body weight status based on their weight (in kilograms) and height (in feet). Upon entering your name, weight in kilograms, and height in feet, the calculator converts height to inches and weight to pounds, then uses the BMI formula for the imperial system to calculate your BMI.

The calculator categorizes your BMI into different ranges, helping you understand where you stand in terms of body weight. These categories include:

**Underweight:** BMI less than 18.5

**Normal Weight:** BMI between 18.5 and 24.9

**Overweight:** BMI between 25 and 29.9

**Obesity:** BMI 30 and above, further categorized into:

- Class 1 Obese: BMI 30-34.9

- Class 2 Obese: BMI 35-39.9

- Class 3 Obese (Severe Obesity): BMI 40 and above

The user is also encouraged to take action based on the results, with a message urging more activity or exercise if needed.
